💰 Problem 3: Calculate Total Order Amount per User

Problem:
You have a collection orders with fields:

{
  userId: ObjectId,
  totalAmount: Number,
  status: String // "delivered", "pending", "cancelled"
}


Find each user’s total delivered order amount and sort users by their total amount in descending order.
